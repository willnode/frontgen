<summary>Why? (with some rants)</summary>
<hr>
This is an in progress work to end my suffering with web development.

Developing UI's is fun until you start to realize you have to do it twice.

Why designing and implementing the code is a separate work? Developer time is expensive, we have to shrink it down to one.

Unfortunately, there are no solution that's fit me. Well, sure there are many options to website builders, but once you use it, you're locked down. If you have paid for these you sure know what I mean.

This is my attempt to fulfill my need. Once you're building your website here, you are not locked down. It's generating a clean coded HTML based on the CSS framework you choose. You can edit your website just like you're designing with your usual tool.

CSS frameworks supported: Bootstrap only. I'll expand the options later (for Bulma, TailwindCSS, PureCSS, etc.). Just crossing over to this repo? You can [try this tool right now](https://willnode.github.io/frontgen/).

My goal with this project is so I can develop prototype websites with minimal code interfere. I'm not aiming to get complete drag-and-drop experience so you can forget to learn how to code and use CSS frameworks, not like that. But atleast I can cut my work time to search for code examples in documentations.

Please ‚≠ê this repo so I know if enough people actually want this project get more polished. Thanks!
